abstract = {Why is it that sometimes small droughts trigger serious crop losses while in other cases even large droughts do not have such a major effect? In this paper, we identify socio-economic indicators associated with sensitivity and resilience to drought for each of China's main grain crops (rice, wheat and corn). Provincial harvest and rainfall data (1961-2001) are used to calculate an annual "crop-drought vulnerability index". We separate "sensitive cases" (where significant harvest losses occurred in years with only minor droughts) and "resilient cases" (where harvest losses were minimal despite there being a major drought) and explore the socio-economic characteristics of these different situations. Results show that sensitive cases were particularly common in economically poor landlocked provinces and in wealthy coastal areas that have a limited land base. In such "sensitive cases", the size of the rural population and the quantity of agricultural inputs were negatively correlated with drought vulnerability, while for resilient cases, vulnerability was negatively correlated with the abundance of land. This leads us to propose a series of drought-vulnerability typologies based on the extent to which land, labour, capital, agricultural technology, and infrastructure buffer or exacerbate the effect of a drought event. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {19,980 crop yield forecasts have been published for the European Union (EU) Member States (MS) during 1993–2015 using the MARS-Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS). We assess the performance of these forecasts for soft wheat, durum wheat, grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower, potato and sugar beet, and sought to answer three questions. First, how good has the system performed? This was investigated by calculating several accuracy indicators (e.g. the mean absolute percentage error, MAPE) for the first forecasts during a season, forecasts one month pre-harvest, and the end-of-campaign (EOC) forecasts during 2006–2015 using reported yields. Second, do forecasts improve during the season? This was evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the first, the pre-harvest, and the EOC forecasts. Third, have forecasts systematically improved year-to-year? This was quantified by testing whether linear models fitted to the median of the national level absolute relative forecast errors for each crop at EU-12 (EU-27) level from 1993 to 2015 (2006–2015) were characterized by significant negative slopes. Encouragingly, the lowest median MAPE across all crops is obtained for Europe's largest producer, France, equalling 3.73{\%}. Similarly, the highest median MAPE is obtained for Portugal, at 14.37{\%}. Forecasts generally underestimated reported yields, with a systematic underestimation across all MS for soft wheat, rapeseed and sugar beet forecasts. Forecasts generally improve during the growing season; both the forecast error and its variability tend to progressively decrease. This is the case for the cereals, and to a lesser extent for the tuber crops, while seasonal forecast improvements are lower for the oilseed crops. The median EU-12 yield forecasts for rapeseed, potato and sugar beet have significantly (p-value {\textless} 0.05) improved from 1993 to 2015. No evidence was found for improvements for the other crops, neither was there any significant improvement in any of the crop forecasts from 2006 to 2015, evaluated at EU-27 level. In the early years of the MCYFS, most of the yield time series were characterized by strong trends; nowadays yield growth has slowed or even plateaued in several MS. In addition, an increased volatility in yield statistics is observed, and while crop yield forecasts tend to improve in a given year, in recent years, there is no evidence of structural improvements that carry-over from year-to-year. This underlines that renewed efforts to improve operational crop yield forecasting are needed, especially in the light of the increasingly variable and occasionally unprecedented climatic conditions impacting the EU's crop production systems.},

Four crop models, SOYGRO, CERES-Maize, CERES-Wheat, and CERES-Rice in DSSAT, were used as effect models and their parameter modification, validation, and sensitivity analyses were carried out using the baseline weather, statistical yield data of the 4 crops, and the local typical soil data. When running the effect models under both baseline and various (CC+$\Delta$CV) scenarios, with the comparison between the simulated outputs, the potential impacts of changes in both climate and its variability on regional food production with a doubling of CO2 were assessed. The results showed that the 4 effect models were available in the 3 agro-ecological zones and could be used as tools in climate impact studies. Generally, climate change would be favorable for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and rice (Oryza sativa L.) productions in the studied regions, especially in the Northern Cold Zone and Eastern Wet Zone. In contrast, it was unfavorable for maize (Zea mays L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productions. Particularly, the maize yields would reduce significantly under all scenarios. With the increase of CV, the rainfed crops, such as soybean, maize, and spring wheat, were negatively affected in decreases of yield and yield stability, whereas, the irrigated rice was in less influence. {\textcopyright} 2008 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Uncertainty in spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in regional crop yield simulations comprises a major fraction of the error on crop model simulation results. In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and grain maize were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992-2000. The results were evaluated on the basis of regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66{\%}) where a relationship could be established. For grain maize the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56{\%} of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for grain maize, because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed spatial and temporal patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated. These results clearly indicate that additional sources of error need to be included in the simulations and observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Three existing models are coupled to assess crop development and forecast yield in the largest contiguous irrigation network in the world: the Indus Basin in Pakistan. Monteith's model is used for the calculation of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), the Carnegie Institution Stanford model is used for determining the light use efficiency, and the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is used to describe the spatio-temporal variability in land wetness conditions. The new model requires a crop identification map and some standard meteorological measurements as inputs. The conversion of above ground dry biomass into crop yield has been calibrated through harvest indices and the values obtained are compared with the international literature. The computations were executed in a GIS environment using 20 satellite measurements of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to cover an annual crop rotation cycle. The validation with district data revealed a root mean square error of 525, 616, 551 and 13,484 kg ha-1 for wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane yield, respectively. The model performs satisfactorily for wheat, rice and sugarcane, and poorly for cotton. It is expected that the accuracy of the model applied to 1.1 km pixels decreases with the increasing number of crops occurring within a given pixel. Although AVHRR is basically too coarse a resolution for field scale crop yield estimations, the results provides yield predictions to policy makers in Pakistan with a spatial detail that is better than the traditional district level data. The gaps between the average and the maximum yield are 1075 and 1246 kg ha-1 for wheat and rice, respectively. Future work should rely on the integration of high and low resolution images to estimate field scale crop yields. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An exploratory assessment was undertaken to determine the correlation strength and optimal timing of several commonly used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composited imagery products against crop yields for 10 globally significant agricultural commodities. The crops analyzed included barley, canola, corn, cotton, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, sugarbeets, and wheat. The MODIS data investigated included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), in addition to daytime Land Surface Temperature (DLST) and nighttime LST (NLST). The imagery utilized all had 8-day time intervals, but NDVI had a 250 m spatial resolution while the other products were 1000 m. These MODIS datasets were also assessed from both the Terra and Aqua satellites, with their differing overpass times, to document any differences. A follow-on analysis, using the Terra 250 m NDVI data as a benchmark, looked at the yield prediction utility of NDVI at two spatial scales (250 m vs. 1000 m), two time precisions (8-day vs. 16-day), and also assessed the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, at 250 m, 16-day). The analyses spanned the major farming areas of the United States (US) from the summers of 2008–2013 and used annual county-level average crop yield data from the US Department of Agriculture as a basis. All crops, except rice, showed at least some positive correlations to each of the vegetation related indices in the middle of the growing season, with NDVI performing slightly better than FPAR. LAI was somewhat less strongly correlated and GPP weak overall. Conversely, some of the crops, particularly canola, corn, and soybeans, also showed negative correlations to DLST mid-summer. NLST, however, was never correlated to crop yield, regardless of the crop or seasonal timing. Differences between the Terra and Aqua results were found to be minimal. The 1000 m resolution NDVI showed somewhat poorer performance than the 250 m and suggests spatial resolution is helpful but not a necessity. The 8-day versus 16-day NDVI relationships to yields were very similar other than for the temporal precision. Finally, the EVI often showed the very best performance of all the variables, all things considered.},

These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies.This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

abstract = {Crop yield is a highly complex trait determined by multiple factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions. Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12{\%} of the average yield and 50{\%} of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11{\%} of the average yield and 46{\%} of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype.},

abstract = {Commission VIII, WG VIII/10 ABSTRACT: The objective of the Mars Crop Yield Forecasting Systems (MCYFS) is to provide precise, scientific, traceable independent and timely forecasts for the main crops yields at EU level. The forecasts and analysis are used since 2001 as a benchmark by analysts from DG-Agriculture and Rural Development in charge of food balance estimates. The system is supported by the use of Remote Sensing data, namely SPOT-VEGETATION, NOAA-AVHRR, MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS TERRA and in the future METOP AVHRR too. So a broad spectrum from low to medium resolution data at pan-European level is covered and historical time series go back to 1981 for NOAA and 1998 for SPOT VEGETATION. In order to work with the data operationally, processing chains have been setup to make the data consistent with our requirements concerning near real time delivery (3 days), spatial coverage (pan-Europe), projection and ten day time steps. Moreover tailored indicators like NDVI, fAPAR and DMP are derived. In case of available time-series, difference values of the indicators (e.g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e.g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The data is explored at full resolution or unmixed related to landcover types and aggregated at administrative NUTS 2 level (profile analysis of time series). Special tools to inspect and distribute the data to external users have been developed as well. Furthermore, it is the objective to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects and to retrieve continuous information. Thus, an algorithm based on Swets et al. (1999) is employed. Thereafter, so-called Chronos Key Indicators are derived from the smoothed time-series. Currently, a study is carried out to establish the link between these indicators and (1) state variables of the crop growth simulation (e.g., development stages), and (2) the forecasted yield/production.},

The main focus is given to the so-called leave-p-out CV procedure (Lpo), where p denotes the cardinality of the test set. Closed-form expressions are settled for the Lpo estimator of the risk of projection estimators. These expressions provide a great improvement upon V-fold cross-validation in terms of variability and computational complexity. From a theoretical point of view, closed-form expressions also enable to study the Lpo performance in terms of risk estimation. The optimality of leave-one-out (Loo), that is Lpo with p = 1, is proved among CV procedures used for risk estimation. Two model selection frameworks are also considered: estimation, as opposed to identification. For estimation with finite sample size n, optimality is achieved for p large enough [with p/n = o(1)] to balance the overfitting resulting from the structure of the model collection. For identification, model selection consistency is settled for Lpo as long as p/n is conveniently related to the rate of convergence of the best estimator in the collection: (i) p/n →1 asn→ +∞ with a parametric rate, and (ii) p/n = o(1) with some nonparametric estimators. These theoretical results are validated by simulation experiments.},

abstract = {We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate relationships between white matter anatomy and different reading subskills in typical-reading adults. A series of analytic approaches revealed that phonological decoding ability is associated with anatomical markers that do not relate to other reading-related cognitive abilities. Thus, individual differences in phonological decoding might relate to connectivity between a network of cortical regions, while skills like sight word reading might rely less strongly on integration across regions. Specifically, manually-drawn ROIs and probabilistic tractography revealed an association between the volume and integrity of white matter underlying primary auditory cortex and nonword reading ability. In a related finding, more extensive cross-hemispheric connections through the isthmus of the corpus callosum predicted better phonological decoding. Atlas-based white matter ROIs demonstrated that relationships with nonword reading were strongest in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus that connect occipital and anterior temporal cortex with inferior frontal cortex. In contrast, tract volume underlying the left angular gyrus was related to nonverbal IQ. Finally, connectivity underlying functional ROIs that are differentially active during phonological and semantic processing predicted nonword reading and reading comprehension, respectively. Together, these results provide important insights into how white matter anatomy may relate to both typical reading subskills, and perhaps a roadmap for understanding neural connectivity in individuals with reading impairments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Meteorological outputs of the seasonal prediction system were used in a crop yield model to assess the performance and usefulness of such a system for crop yield forecasting. An innovative method for supplying seasonal forecast information to crop simulation models was developed. It consisted in running a crop model from each individual downscaled member output of climate models. An ensemble of crop yield was obtained and a probability distribution function (PDF) was derived. Preliminary results of wheat yield simulations in Europe using downscaled DEMETER seasonal weather forecasts suggest that reliable crop yield predictions can be obtained using an ensemble multi-model approach. When compared to the operational system, for the same level of accuracy, earlier crop forecasts are obtained with the DEMETER system. Furthermore, PDFs of wheat yield provide information on both the yield anomaly and the uncertainty of the forecast. Based on the spread of the PDF, the user can directly quantify the benefits and risk of taking weather-sensitive decisions. It is shown that the use of ensembles of seasonal weather forecast brings additional information for the crop yield forecasts and therefore has valuable benefit for decision-making in the management of European Union agricultural production.},

abstract = {Although Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor have been extensively used to assess crop condition and yield on the Canadian Prairies and elsewhere, NDVI data derived from the new moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor have so far not been used for crop yield prediction on the Canadian Prairies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using MODIS-NDVI to forecast crop yield on the Canadian Prairies and also to identify the best time for making a reliable crop yield forecast. Growing season (May-August) MODIS 10-day composite NDVI data for the years 2000-2006 were obtained from the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS). Crop yield data (i.e., barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat) for each Census Agricultural Region (CAR) were obtained from Statistics Canada. Correlation and regression analyses were performed using 10-day composite NDVI and running average NDVI for 2, 3 and 4 dekads with the highest correlation coefficients (r) as the independent variables and crop grain yield as the dependent variable. To test the robustness and the ability of the generated regression models to forecast crops grain yield, one year at a time was removed and new regression models were developed, which were then used to predict the grain yield for the missing year. Results showed that MODIS-NDVI data can be used effectively to predict crop yield on the Canadian Prairies. Depending on the agro-climatic zone, the power function models developed for each crop accounted for 48 to 90{\%}, 32 to 82{\%}, 53 to 89{\%} and 47 to 80{\%} of the grain yield variability for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively, with the best prediction in the semi-arid zone. Overall (54 out of 84), the {\%} difference of the predicted from the actual grain yield was within ±10{\%}. On the whole, RMSE values ranged from 150 to 654, 108 to 475, 204 to 677 and 104 to 714kgha-1 for barley, canola, field peas and spring wheat, respectively. When expressed as percentages of actual yield, the RMSE values ranged from 8 to 25{\%} for barley, 10 to 58{\%} for canola, 10 to 38{\%} for field peas and 6 to 34{\%} for spring wheat. The MAE values followed a similar trend but were slightly lower than the RMSE values. For all the crops, the best time for making grain yield predictions was found to be from the third dekad of June through the third dekad of July in the sub-humid zone and from the first dekad of July through the first dekad of August in both the semi-arid and arid zones. This means that accurate crop grain yield forecasts using the developed regression models can be made one to two months before harvest. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Numerous efforts have been made to develop various indices using remote sensing data such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) for mapping and monitoring of drought and assessment of vegetation health and productivity. NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall are valuable sources of information for the estimation and prediction of crop conditions. In the present paper, we have considered NDVI, soil moisture, surface temperature and rainfall data of Iowa state, US, for 19 years for crop yield assessment and prediction using piecewise linear regression method with breakpoint. Crop production environment consists of inherent sources of heterogeneity and their non-linear behavior. A non-linear Quasi-Newton multi-variate optimization method is utilized, which reasonably minimizes inconsistency and errors in yield prediction. Minimization of least square loss function has been carried out through iterative convergence using pre-defined empirical equation that provided acceptable lower residual values with predicted values very close to observed ones (R2 = 0.78) for Corn and Soybean crop (R2 = 0.86) for Iowa state. The crop yield prediction model discussed in the present paper will further improve in future with the use of long period dataset. Similar model can be developed for different crops of other locations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gyamerah2020,
abstract = {A reliable and accurate forecasting model for crop yields is of crucial importance for efficient decision-making process in the agricultural sector. However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties, most forecasting models for crop yield are not reliable and accurate. For measuring the uncertainty in crop yield forecast, a probabilistic forecasting model based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) is proposed. The non-linear structure of random forest is applied to build the non-linear quantile regression forecast model and to capture the non-linear relationship betweeen the weather variables and crop yield. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in approach of Sheather and Jones are used in the density estimation. A case study using groundnut and millet yield in Ghana were presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique. The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and prediction interval normalized average width for the two crops showed that, the constructed prediction intervals captured the observed yields with high coverage probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-E method has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage probability. The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each weather variable in building the quantile random forest model. The farmer and other stakeholders are able to realize the specific weather variable that affects the yield of a selected crop through feature importance. The proposed method and its application on crop yield dataset are the first of its kind in literature.},

@article{Ren2008,
abstract = {The significance of crop yield estimation is well known in agricultural management and policy development at regional and national levels. The primary objective of this study was to test the suitability of the method, depending on predicted crop production, to estimate crop yield with a MODIS-NDVI-based model on a regional scale. In this paper, MODIS-NDVI data, with a 250 m resolution, was used to estimate the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in one of the main winter-wheat-growing regions. Our study region is located in Jining, Shandong Province. In order to improve the quality of remote sensing data and the accuracy of yield prediction, especially to eliminate the cloud-contaminated data and abnormal data in the MODIS-NDVI series, the Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to smooth the 10-day NDVI data. The spatial accumulation of NDVI at the county level was used to test its relationship with winter wheat production in the study area. A linear regressive relationship between the spatial accumulation of NDVI and the production of winter wheat was established using a stepwise regression method. The average yield was derived from predicted production divided by the growing acreage of winter wheat on a county level. Finally, the results were validated by the ground survey data, and the errors were compared with the errors of agro-climate models. The results showed that the relative errors of the predicted yield using MODIS-NDVI are between -4.62{\%} and 5.40{\%} and that whole RMSE was 214.16 kg ha-1 lower than the RMSE (233.35 kg ha-1) of agro-climate models in this study region. A good predicted yield data of winter wheat could be got about 40 days ahead of harvest time, i.e. at the booting-heading stage of winter wheat. The method suggested in this paper was good for predicting regional winter wheat production and yield estimation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Wheat is one of the key cereal crops grown worldwide, providing the primary caloric and nutritional source for millions of people around the world. In order to ensure food security and sound, actionable mitigation strategies and policies for management of food shortages, timely and accurate estimates of global crop production are essential. This study combines a new BRDF-corrected, daily surface reflectance dataset developed from NASA's Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) with detailed official crop statistics to develop an empirical, generalized approach to forecast wheat yields. The first step of this study was to develop and evaluate a regression-based model for forecasting winter wheat production in Kansas. This regression-based model was then directly applied to forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine. The forecasts of production in Kansas closely matched the USDA/NASS reported numbers with a 7{\%} error. The same regression model forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine within 10{\%} of the official reported production numbers six weeks prior to harvest. Using new data from MODIS, this method is simple, has limited data requirements, and can provide an indication of winter wheat production shortfalls and surplus prior to harvest in regions where minimal ground data is available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},
